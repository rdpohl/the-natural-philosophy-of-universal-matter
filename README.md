# The Natural Philosophy of Universal Matter

The PDF file "The Natual Philosophy of Universal Matter" contains the central philosophy for this project. There is a companion presentation for this philosophy found in the folder "On-Particle-Size". The folder provides Python code that, when run, produces a report used to gauge sizing for the various elements in the philosophy. The sections of the report can be run in corelation to the philosophy.

The PDF file, "On-Particle-Movement" extends the central philosophy adding further insight into the Field of {f}. 

Also, the PDF file, "On-Light" extends the central philosophy adding further insight into the Field of {f}.

An additional sub-folder provide additional insight into the central philosophy. The sub-folder "Structure-of-Elements" carries on from the central philosophy and its building of a hydrogen atom, to show how all of the other elements in the Periodic Table are constructed. Note: This sus-folder has it's own README.
